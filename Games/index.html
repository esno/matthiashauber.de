<h1>Games</h1>

<p>This section provides information about games running fully or partially on linux.
It also give some guidance on how to get them working.
For games I'm not only interested in gaming but also in technical details of implementation
I will write down some deep dives into protocols and reverse engineering as well.</p>

<h2>Diablo II</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Diablo II is an action role-playing hack-and-slash computer video game developed by Blizzard North and
    published by Blizzard Entertainment in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Classic Mac OS, and macOS.
    The game, with its dark fantasy and horror themes, was conceptualized and designed by David Brevik and
    Erich Schaefer, who, with Max Schaefer, acted as project leads on the game.
    The producers were Matthew Householder and Bill Roper.</p>
    
    <p>Building on the success of its predecessor, Diablo (1997), Diablo II was one of the most popular games of 2000 and
    has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made.
    Major factors that contributed to the game's success include its continuation of popular fantasy themes from the previous game and
    its access to Blizzard's free online play service, Battle.net.

<h3>Diablo II: Lord of Destruction</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is an expansion pack for the hack and slash action role-playing game Diablo II.
    Unlike the original Diablo's expansion pack, Diablo: Hellfire, it is a first-party expansion developed by Blizzard North.</p>
    
    <p>Lord of Destruction added content in the form of two new character classes, new weapons and an addition of a fifth act,
    and also dramatically revamped the gameplay of the existing Diablo II for solo and especially multiplayer.

<h2>World of Warcraft</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)
    released in 2004 by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the fourth released game set in the Warcraft fantasy universe.
    World of Warcraft takes place within the Warcraft world of Azeroth,
    approximately four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous Warcraft release,
    Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.
    The game was announced in 2001, and was released for the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise on November 23, 2004.

<h3>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade is the first expansion set for the MMORPG World of Warcraft.
    It was released on January 16, 2007 at local midnight in Europe and North America,
    selling nearly 2.4 million copies on release day alone and making it, at the time,
    the fastest-selling PC game released at that point.
    Approximately 3.53 million copies were sold in the first month of release, including 1.9 million in North America,
    nearly 1.6 million in Europe, and over 100,000 copies in Australasia.

<h3>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</h3>

<blockquote>
    <p>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King is the second expansion set for the
    massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) World of Warcraft,
    following The Burning Crusade. It launched on November 13, 2008 and sold 2.8 million copies within the first day,
    making it the fastest selling computer game of all time released at that point.
    The game added a substantial amount of new content into the game world, including the new continent of Northrend,
    home of the eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. In order to advance through Northrend,
    players are required to reach at least level 68 and the level cap for the expansion is 80.
    The first hero class was introduced, the Death Knight, that starts at level 55.
