# Hardware

This section provides information about all kind of hardware.
Starting from x86/amd64 based computers up to small development boards,
handhelds running on a arm/arm64 and any other kind of interesting
microcontroller.

It's focused on the very first steps for each hardware to either
break out of the origin firmware or just run a custom OS.
