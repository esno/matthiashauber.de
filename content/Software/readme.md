# Software

A collection of my projects. This place aims to provide a detailed description to them
as well as a documentation if one is necessary.

A full list of my personal projects ca be found on [github](https://github.com/esno).

Beside of that this section focuses mostly on plain software - independent of any kind of hardware
while others may more related to [hardware](../Hardware) and therefore are located there.
