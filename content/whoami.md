I'm passionated in linux and opensource for many years.
Back in the late 1990's I started running [debian](https://debian.org) on my first server
and gave [suse](https://suse.com) a shot for my old desktop computer.

At that time I recognized the big benefits of opensource,
switched over to [gentoo](https://gentoo.org) and digged into kernel internals.
Which in fact took me a lot of time for maintenance and debugging but lead to
the fact that I learned so much about software packaging/lifecycle
and debugging system internals.

Since I am hired as a linux system architect I profit a lot from my
taken experience which I gathered within different opensource communities.
And that's why I want to share some snippets of my knowledge and push back
as much code as possible.
