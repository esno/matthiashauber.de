<h1>Oculus Quest</h1>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>At the time of purchase the Oculus Quest it was not required to own a facebook account.
Meanwhile it's - unfortunatelly - required to have one. Since that decision were made
some may cry and remember to promises made by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey.
But all I found was a guarantee on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21cy9n/the_future_of_vr/cgbz2vw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">reddit</a>
only related to Oculus Rift. Beside of that, facebook changed the game and theres nothing to add.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<pre><code>Processor       : AArch64 Processor rev 4 (aarch64)
processor       : 0
BogoMIPS        : 38.40
Features        : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32
CPU implementer : 0x51
CPU architecture: 8
CPU variant     : 0xa
CPU part        : 0x801

Hardware        : Qualcomm Technologies, Inc APQ8998
</code></pre>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>Install the Oculus smartphone app and pair the device via bluetooth.</p>

<h3>Developer mode</h3>

<p>The Oculus Quest provides a developer mode for developing applications.
To enable the developer mode browse to <a href="https://dashboard.oculus.com/organizations/create/">Oculus Dashboard</a>
and create a new organization.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>facebook's NDA is a nightmare. Think about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open the app, select the Oculus Quest, go to settings and enable "Developer mode"</p>

<p>In some place of the agreements there was a note about potential account locking
based on non-defined activities. As for now I'm pretty not sure what may end in a account lock
and how they're monitoring such things.
Maybe it's only related to online activities like cheating. Maybe it's based on an stuff you wrote that becomes popular.</p>

<h2>Android Debug Bridge</h2>

<pre><code># adb devices
* daemon not running; starting now at tcp:5037
* daemon started successfully
List of devices attached
XXXXXXXXXXXXXX  unauthorized
</code></pre>

<p>If your device is listed as unauthorized you need to allow usb debugging.
Put on your headset and allow debugging</p>

<pre><code>Allow USB debugging?

The computers RSA key fingerprint is:
[...]

[] Always allow from this computer
[cancel] [ok]
</code></pre>

<p>Now your Oculus Quest should be listed as device</p>

<pre><code>[root@abacus crito]# adb devices
List of devices attached
XXXXXXXXXXXXX  device
</code></pre>
